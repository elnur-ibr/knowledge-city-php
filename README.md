#Started working
##Identify key objective of the project
- security
  - sql injection
  - sanitize inputs
  - storing sensitive information. Should be hased. Like Password.
- clean code
- OOP

##Though
- Session maybe
- Just create random string and use it as JWT
  - where should I store token
- Might seem to be easy way but going to use MVC/Laravel structure.
  - nothing special required in the task.
- Might add error logging but seems out off scope.
- MIght use singleton pattern but seems out of scope.
