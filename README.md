##Though
- Session maybe
- Just create random string and use it as JWT
  - where should I store token
- Might seem to be easy way but going to use MVC/Laravel structure.
  - nothing special required in the task.
- Might add error logging but seems out off scope.
- MIght use singleton pattern but seems out of scope.
- Could have added a lot more exception handlers
- Not creating model relations.
- ***There could be done a lot improvment on both sides (back-end and front-end)***
